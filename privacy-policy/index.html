          <h3>Statement</h3>
          <p>
            While a simple policy is sufficient, I'll still copy and paste this
            long privacy policy here.

          <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            I value your privacy and want to be transparent about how data is
            handled when you visit this website. This website does not collect,
            store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII),
            such as your name, email address, phone number, or IP address.

          <h3>Use of Google Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            To help me understand how people interact with this website and
            improve the overall experience, I use Google Analytics, a
            third-party tool that collects general usage data. While I don’t
            personally collect or store any of your personal information, Google
            Analytics gathers anonymous data through cookies and similar
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s what Google Analytics may collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Country of access:</strong>
              This tells me the general region (by country) where visitors are
              coming from. It helps me understand where my readers are based and
              how to better serve different audiences.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Page title and screen class:</strong>
              This is part of the "Pages and Screens" report, which shows how
              users engage with specific pages or screens. It helps me see which
              posts are most popular and how people move through the site.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Traffic acquisition:</strong>
              This report shows how visitors arrive at the blog—whether through
              search engines, social media, direct visits, or other sources. It
              helps me understand which channels are most effective in reaching
              new readers.
