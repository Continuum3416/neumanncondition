            time reading research papers and online scientific blogs, as a
            result, I got inspired by some of them and decided to create this
            website. This website was created for uploading my writings and
            projects.

          <h3 class="home-h3-headers">About this website</h3>
          <h4>Background and Choice of Design</h4>
          <p>
            This website was formally built back in summer of 2024, but I've
            been writing a lot of the content on this website on LaTeX
            documentations way before that. I coded this website from scratch
            using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript (ancient and primitive, I
            know, but they works). For this reason, the website might not be
            very well-optimized, so please excuse me. To view the source code,
            click on the logo on the side navigation bar or follow this
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Continuum3416/neumanncondition"
              class="url"
              >link</a
            >.

          <ul style="line-height: 1.6">
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Question</strong>: Why not use a framework or a static
              site generator?
            </li>
            <li style="margin: var(--in-page-li-spacing) 0">
              <strong>Answer</strong>: I wanted to learn the basics of web
              development, so in order to learn, I must create things. This
              website the became my first web project. Plus, this site has no
              complex API calls, so a framework would be overkill, although
              using a framework would have probably been a bit easier. Ok, but
              why not a static site generator like Jekyll? I feel like static
              site generators offer much less control over things, such as the
              ability to easily create highly customizable components like this
              one:
              <div
                class="theorem"
                data-theorem-name=" (The Hairy Ball Theorem)"
              >
                There is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on
                even-dimensional n-spheres.
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The fun part about building something from scratch is having
            fine-grained control over everything. But at the same time, too much
            control can be a real headache. Instead of using pre-built
            components or a template like any sane person would, I had to write
            thousands of lines of CSS and Javascript and make sure that it works
            well on both desktop and mobile. Now that I'm looking back, I think
            that it was a real pain and a waste of time, but here we are.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, all of it still ties back to one thing: future-proofing
            my work. Whenever I create something, I always think about my future
            self. I constantly ask how I can make things a bit easier down the
            line, like the choice of loading certain components dynamically.
            This choice actually tanked performance, but it did make things
            easier for me whenever I want to add, let's say a new section on the
            top bar. Because of that, I've lost count of how many times I've
            changed the design just to make the process of updating content
            easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don't get me wrong. I DO place a major emphasis on
            efficiency, optimization, and speed. But that's only for my work in
            system programming, or if it's something related to web dev that
            really needs performance, I'd just use a framework like Next. For a
            personal, hobby project like this, I don't really care. The slight
            inefficiency is small enough to be considered negligible, and I'm
            happy with that.
          </p>

          <h4>Additional Tools</h4>
          <p>
            Some other tools I used are
            <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" class="url">MathJax</a>, a
            javascript library that helps display fancy equation like this:
          </p>
          <div class="equation">
            $$ \rho h\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} = - D\nabla^4 w +
            T\nabla^2 w -K_0w -K_1\pd{w}{t} + T_1\nabla^2\pd{w}{t} +
            F(\textbf{x}, t). $$
          </div>
          <p>
            I also use
            <a href="https://prismjs.com/" class="url">prism.js</a> to provide
            some nice code syntax-highlighting for websites like below. You can
            change the code theme in the setting
          </p>

            The general layout of this website should be completed, but I will
            still add some new features every once in a while, if I have time.
            This website is still relatively new anyway.
          </p>
          <p>Some features I might add in the future:</p>
